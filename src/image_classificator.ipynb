To make it clear, consider the problem of determining whether a fingerprint exists in an image or not. You create a dataset with several of fingerprints you would like to train the model to recognize, but what about instances of \"Not Fingerprint\" images? Instances of \"Not Fingerprint\" are nearly infinite."
