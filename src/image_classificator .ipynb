    "In machine learning, **binary classification** is a <u>some text</u> algorithm that categorizes images into one of two classes. You provide two datasets of images, a **label** for each one, and the algorithm will learn from it classifying both label in  0 or 1."

    "Doubtless, binary classification is widely spread, and it does work well in many scenarios. But, what if I just want to be able to recognize one single image? To make it clear, consider the problem of determining whether a fingerprint exists in an image or not. You create a dataset with several of fingerprints you would like to train the model to recognize, but what about instances of \"Not Fingerprint\" images? Instances of \"Not Fingerprint\" are nearly infinite."
